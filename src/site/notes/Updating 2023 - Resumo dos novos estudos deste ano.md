>[!abstract]- **Rituximab vs Cyclophosphamide Induction Therapy for Patients With Granulomatosis With Polyangiitis** (Guy Katz, JAMA, Jan 2023)
>
>The authors of this comparative effectiveness study assessed the efficacy of rituximab versus cyclophosphamide as induction therapy for patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). The results showed that rituximab was associated with significantly higher rates of remission at 6 months compared with cyclophosphamide. This effect was amplified in patients with proteinase-3 positivity.
>
>The findings of this study support prior studies showing the noninferiority and trend towards higher remission rates with rituximab when compared with cyclophosphamide. Physicians can use this information to help guide treatment decisions in patients with GPA.

>[!Example]- **Diffusing Capacity as a Predictor of Mortality in Patients With COPD** (Balasubramanian, Respiratory Medicine, Jan 2023)
>The authors of this large study of patients from the COPDGene cohort found that, in patients with COPD, a decline in diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is associated with an increased rate of mortality (P < .001). 
>
>While several other parameters are typically used in COPD (6-minute walk test and FEV1), this study highlights the applicability and validity of using DLCO as a predictor of mortality in patients with COPD.

> [!info]- **Validation of Proposed Criteria for Progressive Pulmonary Fibrosis** (JV Pugashetti, Respiratory Medicine, Jan 2023)
> 
> The authors of this retrospective, multicenter, cohort study of patients from the US and UK with non–idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) forms of interstitial lung disease (ILD) found that a forced vital capacity (FVC) decline of ≥10% was the strongest predictor of reduced transplant-free survival; however, several other pulmonary function and imaging criteria were also found to be significantly associated with transplant-free survival. Furthermore, transplant-free survival was better in patients with non-IPF subtypes compared with those subsequently diagnosed with IPF.
> 
> This study validates the use of FVC in progressive pulmonary fibrosis. It also highlights the wide variability across ILD subtypes.
