>[!abstract] **Rituximab vs Cyclophosphamide Induction Therapy for Patients With Granulomatosis With Polyangiitis** (Guy Katz, JAMA, Jan 2023)
>
>The authors of this comparative effectiveness study assessed the efficacy of rituximab versus cyclophosphamide as induction therapy for patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). The results showed that rituximab was associated with significantly higher rates of remission at 6 months compared with cyclophosphamide. This effect was amplified in patients with proteinase-3 positivity.
>
>The findings of this study support prior studies showing the noninferiority and trend towards higher remission rates with rituximab when compared with cyclophosphamide. Physicians can use this information to help guide treatment decisions in patients with GPA.

>[!note] **Diffusing Capacity as a Predictor of Mortality in Patients With COPD** (Balasubramanian, Respiratory Medicine, Jan 2023)
>The authors of this large study of patients from the COPDGene cohort found that, in patients with COPD, a decline in diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is associated with an increased rate of mortality (P < .001). 
>
>While several other parameters are typically used in COPD (6-minute walk test and FEV1), this study highlights the applicability and validity of using DLCOÂ as a predictor of mortality in patients with COPD.

Nao tou a perceber pq e que isto nao fica mais
