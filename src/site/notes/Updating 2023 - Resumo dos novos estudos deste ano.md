>[!abstract]- **Rituximab vs Cyclophosphamide Induction Therapy for Patients With Granulomatosis With Polyangiitis (Guy Katz, JAMA, Jan 2023)**
>
>The authors of this comparative effectiveness study assessed the efficacy of rituximab versus cyclophosphamide as induction therapy for patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). The results showed that rituximab was associated with significantly higher rates of remission at 6 months compared with cyclophosphamide. This effect was amplified in patients with proteinase-3 positivity.
>
>The findings of this study support prior studies showing the noninferiority and trend towards higher remission rates with rituximab when compared with cyclophosphamide. Physicians can use this information to help guide treatment decisions in patients with GPA.

>[!Example]- **Diffusing Capacity as a Predictor of Mortality in Patients With COPD (Balasubramanian, Respiratory Medicine, Jan 2023)**
>The authors of this large study of patients from the COPDGene cohort found that, in patients with COPD, a decline in diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is associated with an increased rate of mortality (P < .001).
>
>While several other parameters are typically used in COPD (6-minute walk test and FEV1), this study highlights the applicability and validity of using DLCO as a predictor of mortality in patients with COPD.

> [!info]- **Validation of Proposed Criteria for Progressive Pulmonary Fibrosis (JV Pugashetti, Respiratory Medicine, Jan 2023)**
>
> The authors of this retrospective, multicenter, cohort study of patients from the US and UK with non–idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) forms of interstitial lung disease (ILD) found that a forced vital capacity (FVC) decline of ≥10% was the strongest predictor of reduced transplant-free survival; however, several other pulmonary function and imaging criteria were also found to be significantly associated with transplant-free survival. Furthermore, transplant-free survival was better in patients with non-IPF subtypes compared with those subsequently diagnosed with IPF.
>
> This study validates the use of FVC in progressive pulmonary fibrosis. It also highlights the wide variability across ILD subtypes.

>[!Abstract]- **Association of the Use of Novel Antihyperglycaemic Drug with Prevention of COPD Exacerbations Among Patients With Type 2 Diabetes (R Pradhan, BMC, Nov 2022)**
>
>  This population-based cohort study evaluated data from individuals who were new users of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, sodium–glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, or sulfonylureas with a history of diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to determine whether the use of these medications decreases the risk of COPD exacerbations in these individuals. Compared with sulfonylureas, GLP-1 receptor agonists were associated with a decreased risk of moderate and severe COPD exacerbation, SGLT-2 inhibitors were associated with a decreased risk of severe COPD exacerbation, and DPP-4 inhibitors did not show a consistent association. There are multiple possibilities for the reasons of this decreased risk, including the anti-inflammatory properties of GLP-1 receptor agonists and the decreased carbon dioxide production associated with SGLT-2 inhibitors.
>
>  As the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors is becoming common, there is increasing information about the benefits of these medications in many realms. This study suggests that these classes of medications can also decrease the risk of COPD exacerbation in individuals with diabetes using these medications.

>[!danger]- 🥇 **Efficacy and Safety of 24-Week All-Oral Regimens for Rifampin-Resistant Tuberculosis (BT Nyang'wa, NEMJ, Jan 2023)**
>This open-label, phase II to III, multicenter, randomized, controlled noninferiority trial involving patients older than 15 years in Belarus, South Africa, and Uzbekistan with rifampin-resistant tuberculosis compared three 24-week oral medication regimens with the standard-of-care oral and intravenous 9- to 20-month regimens. The results demonstrated that this 24-week oral regimen was noninferior to the current WHO standard of care and was associated with fewer adverse effects by the 72-week point. This trial supports a regimen for rifampin-resistant tuberculosis that, in addition to being effective, seems to be more patient-friendly, given the shorter duration and all oral form. It is likely that compliance with this type of regimen among patients will be better than that with the alternative.


>[!Example]- **Progression-Free Survival, and Local-Regional Control in Patents with Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treated With Chemoradiation and Durvalumab (ES Lebow, JAMA Network Open 2023)**
In this cohort study, the authors evaluated the association between tumor mutational burden (TMB) and clinical outcomes in 81 patients with locally advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with chemoradiation and consolidative durvalumab. Patients with TMB-high status had significantly improved local–regional control and progression-free survival outcomes compared with those with TMB-low status.. The results of this study suggest that analysis of TMB may serve as a pivotal biomarker in the ongoing management of patients with locally advanced NSCLC.


> [!tip]- Efficacy of Opt-Out vs Opt-In Treatment Strategy in Individuals Who Use Tobacco (Respiratory Medicine, 2023)
>  In this randomized clinical trial, the authors sought to evaluate the effects of an opt-out versus opt-in smoking cessation intervention in patients at hospital discharge. Patients in the opt-out group were provided medications, tool kits, and counseling; patients in the opt-in group who were willing to quit were also offered the same interventions. Patients in the opt-out group demonstrated significantly more treatment engagement and quit attempts while also endorsing increased therapeutic alliance with healthcare providers. **The results of this study suggest that providing tobacco users with smoking cessation tools may be effective even in patients who do not initially express the willingness to quit**. This strategy has the potential to significantly increase the cessation rate among all smokers.
