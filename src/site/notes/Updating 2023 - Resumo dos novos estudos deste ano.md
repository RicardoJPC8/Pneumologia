>[!abstract]- **Rituximab vs Cyclophosphamide Induction Therapy for Patients With Granulomatosis With Polyangiitis** (Guy Katz, JAMA, Jan 2023)
>
>The authors of this comparative effectiveness study assessed the efficacy of rituximab versus cyclophosphamide as induction therapy for patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). The results showed that rituximab was associated with significantly higher rates of remission at 6 months compared with cyclophosphamide. This effect was amplified in patients with proteinase-3 positivity.
>
>The findings of this study support prior studies showing the noninferiority and trend towards higher remission rates with rituximab when compared with cyclophosphamide. Physicians can use this information to help guide treatment decisions in patients with GPA.

>[!Example]- **Diffusing Capacity as a Predictor of Mortality in Patients With COPD** (Balasubramanian, Respiratory Medicine, Jan 2023)
>The authors of this large study of patients from the COPDGene cohort found that, in patients with COPD, a decline in diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is associated with an increased rate of mortality (P < .001).
>
>While several other parameters are typically used in COPD (6-minute walk test and FEV1), this study highlights the applicability and validity of using DLCOÂ as a predictor of mortality in patients with COPD.

> [!info]- **Validation of Proposed Criteria for Progressive Pulmonary Fibrosis** (JV Pugashetti, Respiratory Medicine, Jan 2023)
>
> The authors of this retrospective, multicenter, cohort study of patients from the US and UK with nonâ€“idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) forms of interstitial lung disease (ILD) found that a forced vital capacity (FVC) decline of â‰¥10% was the strongest predictor of reduced transplant-free survival; however, several other pulmonary function and imaging criteria were also found to be significantly associated with transplant-free survival. Furthermore, transplant-free survival was better in patients with non-IPF subtypes compared with those subsequently diagnosed with IPF.
>
> This study validates the use of FVC in progressive pulmonary fibrosis. It also highlights the wide variability across ILD subtypes.

>[!Abstract]- **Association of the Use of Novel Antihyperglycaemic Drug with Prevention of COPD Exacerbations Among Patients With Type 2 Diabetes** (R Pradhan, BMC, Nov 2022)
>
>  This population-based cohort study evaluated data from individuals who were new users of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, sodiumâ€“glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, or sulfonylureas with a history of diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to determine whether the use of these medications decreases the risk of COPD exacerbations in these individuals. Compared with sulfonylureas, GLP-1 receptor agonists were associated with a decreased risk of moderate and severe COPD exacerbation, SGLT-2 inhibitors were associated with a decreased risk of severe COPD exacerbation, and DPP-4 inhibitors did not show a consistent association. There are multiple possibilities for the reasons of this decreased risk, including the anti-inflammatory properties of GLP-1 receptor agonists and the decreased carbon dioxide production associated with SGLT-2 inhibitors.
>
>  As the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors is becoming common, there is increasing information about the benefits of these medications in many realms. This study suggests that these classes of medications can also decrease the risk of COPD exacerbation in individuals with diabetes using these medications.

>[!danger]- ðŸ¥‡ **Efficacy and Safety of 24-Week All-Oral Regimens for Rifampin-Resistant Tuberculosis** (BT Nyang'wa, NEMJ, Jan 2023 )
>
 > ***Summary***
> *This open-label, phase II to III, multicenter, randomized, controlled noninferiority trial involving patients older than 15 years in Belarus, South Africa, and Uzbekistan with rifampin-resistant tuberculosis compared three 24-week oral medication regimens with the standard-of-care oral and intravenous 9- to 20-month regimens. The results demonstrated that this 24-week oral regimen was noninferior to the current WHO standard of care and was associated with fewer adverse effects by the 72-week point.*
> *This trial supports a regimen for rifampin-resistant tuberculosis that, in addition to being effective, seems to be more patient-friendly, given the shorter duration and all oral form. It is likely that compliance with this type of regimen among patients will be better than that with the alternative.*
>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>Worldwide, about 450,000 persons per year develop rifampin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB), a difficult-to-treat and often deadly form of tuberculosis that includes multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB, a subset of RR-TB that includes resistance to isoniazid) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB, a subset of MDR-TB that includes resistance to the fluoroquinolones and three second-line injectable agents: capreomycin, kanamycin, and amikacin).1Â Unlike drug-susceptible tuberculosis (TB), which is treatable with a well-tolerated, 26-week, all-oral regimen with a treatment success rate of 86% worldwide, RR-TB (including MDR-TB and XDR-TB) requires prolonged treatment lasting 9â€“20 months with standardized regimens involving multiple, highly toxic oral, and/or injectable agents. Treatment success rates for RR-TB are just 60% worldwide, with high rates of mortality and treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects.
>
>In this pragmatic, multicenter, open-label, adaptive, Phase IIâ€“III, randomized, controlled noninferiority trial called TB-PRACTECAL (Pragmatic Clinical Trial for a more Effective, Concise and Less Toxic Regimen), Nyangâ€™wa and colleagues compared three novel all-oral regimens consisting of bedaquiline (B), pretomanid (P), and linezolid (L), with or without clofazimine (C) or moxifloxacin (M), to standard-care treatment that followed WHO guidelines for suspected or confirmed RR-TB.2Â In Stage 1 (Phase II) of the trial, the so-called BPaLM group (n=60) had higher rates of 8-week conversion of liquid mycobacterial cultures from positive to negative (77%) than the BPaLC (67%, n = 60) or BPaL (46%, n = 60) groups.
>
>Thus, in Stage 2 (Phase III), 301 participants were randomized exclusively to BPaLM or standard-care before the Data Safety Monitoring Board stopped the trial early for benefit. The modified intention-to-treat analysis (including only those with microbiologically confirmed RR-TB who received â‰¥1 dose treatment) showed that 48% of the standard-care group had an unfavorable status (death, treatment discontinuation, or loss to follow-up) versus 11% of the BPaLM group (Risk Difference -37%, 95% Confidence Interval â€“53% to â€“22%), confirming both the noninferiority and the superiority of the BPaLM regimen. The BPaLC (19%) and BPaL (23%) groups had similarly low unfavorable status rates, with the differences attributable to all BPaL-containing regimens having much lower treatment discontinuation rates than the standard-care group. Accordingly, there were far fewer serious or grade 3 or higher adverse events in the BPaLM group (19%) than in the BPaL (24%), BPaLC (32%), or standard-care (59%) groups. The main adverse events, hepatotoxicity and QT interval prolongation, were far more common in the standard-care group than in the BPaLM, BPaL, or BPaLC groups, and adverse events due to neuropathy and myelosuppression that were common in studies using higher-dose linezolid.
>
>The trial had several strengths, including the pragmatic design that included participants with all forms of RR-TB. There are also some limitations, such as the open-label design that could explain the higher than expected unfavorable status rate in the standard-care group.2Â The study findings are consistent with two previous trials, showing that short BPaL regimens without moxifloxacin or clofazimine are superior to standard care3,4Â and support regulatory applications to make them routinely available.
>
>In an accompanying Editorial, Diacon offers a cautionary, must-heed warning: antimicrobial resistance has plagued TB care since the first antimicrobial trials.Â Accordingly, careful antimicrobial stewardship and pharmacosurveillance must accompany this novel RR-TB regimen to contain the inevitable mutations that will otherwise lead to the next generation of highly drug-resistant TB.
