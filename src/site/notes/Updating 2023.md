>[!abstract] **Rituximab vs Cyclophosphamide Induction Therapy for Patients With Granulomatosis With Polyangiitis** (Guy Katz, JAMA, Jan 2023)
><!br>
>The authors of this comparative effectiveness study assessed the efficacy of rituximab versus cyclophosphamide as induction therapy for patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). The results showed that rituximab was associated with significantly higher rates of remission at 6 months compared with cyclophosphamide. This effect was amplified in patients with proteinase-3 positivity.
>
>The findings of this study support prior studies showing the noninferiority and trend towards higher remission rates with rituximab when compared with cyclophosphamide. Physicians can use this information to help guide treatment decisions in patients with GPA.
